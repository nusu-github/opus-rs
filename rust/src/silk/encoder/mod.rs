//! SILK encoder state scaffolding.
//!
//! This module gradually mirrors the encoder-side state structures defined in
//! `silk/structs.h`.  Only the fields required by the already-ported helpers are
//! modelled for now; additional members will be introduced alongside their Rust
//! counterparts.
